TODO

color gets stronger when refilling - DONE

how to tell when overflowing?
-color flashes? stops when player isn't slowed down anymore - DONE

how to tell how many sprays to neutralize a green smudge?
-growing is slow when right below thresholds and fast when in the middle - DONE

why are my other sprays neutralizing the wrong smudges?
-make them dramatically worse - DONE


NOTE

question for #design (after playtests?)
-what if all smudges started at a random size between 1 and 3ish? i.e. take 1-3 sprays to neutralize before wiping
  -only after tutorial
  -start at mostly 1, 2 is rare
  -next levels vary it more to be equal distribution between 1-3
